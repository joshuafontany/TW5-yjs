note-heartbeat: Settings for the `heartbeat` that makes sure the browser and server are still connected (mostly in the browser, but also if acting as a federated client). You can almost certainly ignore these settings.
note-heartbeat-interval: The heartbeat message is sent every `interval` milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second). Defaults to 1 second.
note-heartbeat-timeout: The length of time to wait for a heartbeat signal before assuming that the connection is no longer working. Defaults to a 10 second timeout.
note-reconnect: The settings for automatic reconnections.
note-reconnect-auto: Will trigger automatic reconnection attempts if set to `true` (the default).
note-reconnect-base: The base increment in ms.
note-reconnect-max:  The maximum retry increment in ms. Defaults to 60 seconds.
note-reconnect-decay: The exponential decay (d), of (d)^(number-of-retries).
note-reconnect-abort: Automatically abort after this many tries.
